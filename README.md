# Travis Report
A google chrome extension that shows the status of each travis environment for a github PR.

##Installation
1. Install Google Chrome and unzip travis-report
2. Go to settings > extensions
3. Enable Developer Mode
4. Enable Travis Report

##How it works
On any Github PR that uses travis for integration testing, Travis Report will give a rundown of each Enivronment and whether it it is failing or not. This allows users to see what has failed without ever leaving Github. Clicking an environment goes straight to its build page.
